# Agent-Driven Development Roadmap (Advanced)

This roadmap leverages an autonomous agent under human supervision, with built-in CI/CD, testing, and security governance.

## Phase 0: Environment & Governance Setup
- [ ] **Establish Repos & Branching**: Create `main`, `dev`, `agent-ci` branches with protected rules.
- [ ] **Access Control**: Configure GitHub teams, token permissions, and DVC remote access.
- [ ] **Security Policies**: Define code scan, secret scanning, and dependency-check rules in CI.

## Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Vectorization
- [ ] **Ingest ATT&CK & APT Reports**: Agent runs `scripts/convert_pdf_to_txt.py`; human reviews samples.
- [ ] **Corpora Embedding**: Agent executes `scripts/generate_embeddings.py`, stores vectors in FAISS/Milvus.
- [ ] **Data Validation Tests**: Automated checks for schema, duplicates, encoding via `pytest`.
- [ ] **Version Data**: Agent commits via DVC with reproducible pipelines.

## Phase 2: Modeling & Adversarial Training
- [ ] **Adapter Initialization**: Agent loads base LLaMA/Phi-3 via `configs/model_config.yaml`.
- [ ] **Self-Play Loops**: Agent triggers `src/training/adversarial_train.py` with dynamic prompt generation.
- [ ] **Metrics Tracking**: Log loss curves, chain-completion scores to MLflow/W&B.
- [ ] **Model Validation**: Unit tests for generation consistency, safety compliance.

## Phase 3: Agent Development & Integration
- [ ] **Code Generation**: Agent scaffolds modules per `agent-instructions.md` templates.
- [ ] **API Wrappers & Secrets Management**: Use `vault` or GitHub Secrets for Metasploit, CS credentials.
- [ ] **Error Handling & Logging**: Implement structured logging (`JSONLogHandler`) and retry logic.
- [ ] **Human-in-the-Loop**: Insert checkpoints for human approval on critical config changes.

## Phase 4: Orchestration & CI/CD
- [ ] **Workflow Definitions**: YAML workflows in `src/orchestration/` defining branching logic, timeouts.
- [ ] **Agent Pipeline CLI**: Enhance `scripts/run_agents.sh` to support partial runs and dry-run mode.
- [ ] **CI Pipelines**: GitHub Actions workflows for lint, tests, DVC repro, build, and deploy.
- [ ] **Canary Deploys**: Setup staging cluster for smoke tests before production rollouts.

## Phase 5: Evaluation, Benchmarking & Explainability
- [ ] **Benchmark Suite**: Expand to include StealthScore, ChainSuccessRate, FalsePositiveRate.
- [ ] **Explainability Reports**: Agent runs `src/evaluation/explainability_report.py` to produce human-readable rationales.
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Automated SAST/DAST via `trivy` and `bandit` on container images and code.

## Phase 6: Packaging, Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] **Docker & Helm Chart**: Agent builds multi-stage Docker images; updates `charts/cyber-llm`.
- [ ] **Kubernetes Manifests**: Apply `k8s/prod/*.yaml` with resource quotas and network policies.
- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerts**: Configure Prometheus alerts, Grafana dashboards, and Slack notifications.
- [ ] **Chaos Testing**: Introduce network faults in staging to validate resilience.

## Phase 7: Continuous Improvement & Community
- [ ] **Regular Self-Play Scenarios**: Schedule daily automated red-team drills.
- [ ] **Feedback Portal**: Agent collects operator feedback JSON for model retraining.
- [ ] **Adapter Marketplace**: Publish new LoRA adapters via internal PyPI for community.
- [ ] **Documentation Updates**: Auto-generate docs with `mkdocs` and deploy to GitHub Pages.

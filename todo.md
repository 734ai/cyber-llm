# Agent-Driven Development Roadmap (Advanced)

This roadmap leverages an autonomous agent under human supervision, with built-in CI/CD, testing, and security governance.

## Phase 0: Environment & Governance Setup
- [x] **Project Structure**: Created complete directory structure with all necessary folders.
- [x] **Core Files**: Created README.md, requirements.txt, mcp.json, agent-instructions.md.
- [x] **CI Pipeline**: Basic GitHub Actions workflow created in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
- [ ] **Establish Repos & Branching**: Create `main`, `dev`, `agent-ci` branches with protected rules.
- [ ] **Access Control**: Configure GitHub teams, token permissions, and DVC remote access.
- [ ] **Security Policies**: Define code scan, secret scanning, and dependency-check rules in CI.

## Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Vectorization
- [x] **PDF Conversion Script**: Created `scripts/convert_pdf_to_txt.py` for ATT&CK & APT report processing.
- [x] **Embedding Generation**: Created `scripts/generate_embeddings.py` for vector storage.
- [x] **Data Processing**: Created `src/training/preprocess.py` for data cleaning and tokenization.
- [x] **Data Validation Tests**: Created comprehensive `tests/test_data_validation.py` for schema, duplicates, encoding checks.
- [ ] **Version Data**: Agent commits via DVC with reproducible pipelines.

## Phase 2: Modeling & Adversarial Training
- [x] **Model Configuration**: Created `configs/model_config.yaml` and `configs/model_config.py`.
- [x] **Training Scripts**: Created `src/training/train.py` for LoRA adapter training.
- [x] **Adversarial Training**: Created `src/training/adversarial_train.py` with dynamic prompt generation.
- [ ] **Metrics Tracking**: Log loss curves, chain-completion scores to MLflow/W&B.
- [ ] **Model Validation**: Unit tests for generation consistency, safety compliance.

## Phase 3: Agent Development & Integration
- [x] **Core Agents**: Created `recon_agent.py`, `c2_agent.py`, `post_exploit_agent.py`, `safety_agent.py`, and `orchestrator.py`.
- [x] **CLI Interface**: Created `src/deployment/cli/cyber_cli.py` for command-line interface.
- [x] **Basic Testing**: Created initial test files for agents.
- [x] **Explainability Agent**: Created `explainability_agent.py` for decision rationales.
- [ ] **API Wrappers & Secrets Management**: Use `vault` or GitHub Secrets for Metasploit, CS credentials.
- [ ] **Error Handling & Logging**: Implement structured logging (`JSONLogHandler`) and retry logic.
- [ ] **Human-in-the-Loop**: Insert checkpoints for human approval on critical config changes.

## Phase 4: Orchestration & CI/CD
- [x] **Docker Setup**: Created `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerization.
- [x] **Basic CI**: Created `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` for continuous integration.
- [x] **Workflow Definitions**: Created YAML workflows in `src/orchestration/workflows/` for red-team and recon scenarios.
- [ ] **Agent Pipeline CLI**: Enhance `scripts/run_agents.sh` to support partial runs and dry-run mode.
- [ ] **Advanced CI Pipelines**: GitHub Actions workflows for lint, tests, DVC repro, build, and deploy.
- [ ] **Canary Deploys**: Setup staging cluster for smoke tests before production rollouts.

## Phase 5: Evaluation, Benchmarking & Explainability
- [x] **Benchmark Suite**: Created comprehensive evaluation suite with StealthScore, ChainSuccessRate, FalsePositiveRate.
- [ ] **Explainability Reports**: Agent runs `src/evaluation/explainability_report.py` to produce human-readable rationales.
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Automated SAST/DAST via `trivy` and `bandit` on container images and code.

## Phase 6: Packaging, Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] **Docker & Helm Chart**: Agent builds multi-stage Docker images; updates `charts/cyber-llm`.
- [ ] **Kubernetes Manifests**: Apply `k8s/prod/*.yaml` with resource quotas and network policies.
- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerts**: Configure Prometheus alerts, Grafana dashboards, and Slack notifications.
- [ ] **Chaos Testing**: Introduce network faults in staging to validate resilience.

## Phase 7: Continuous Improvement & Community
- [ ] **Regular Self-Play Scenarios**: Schedule daily automated red-team drills.
- [ ] **Feedback Portal**: Agent collects operator feedback JSON for model retraining.
- [ ] **Adapter Marketplace**: Publish new LoRA adapters via internal PyPI for community.
- [ ] **Documentation Updates**: Auto-generate docs with `mkdocs` and deploy to GitHub Pages.
